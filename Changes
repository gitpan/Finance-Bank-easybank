	- the login page itself is now used as entry point and
	  not the easybank frontpage, resulting in a noticeable
	  (depending on your connection) performance gain.
	- removed calls to deprecated WWW::Mechanize methods
	  follow and form.
	- bugfix: get_entries processed all accounts defined
	  in the account-list, and not the ones defined in the
	  entries-list.
        - fixed a few typos in the man page.
	- replaced map with hash slice in example scripts.
	- Agent now identifies itself as 'Mac Safari' :)
